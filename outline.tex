  Preliminary Outline for Dispute Length Project
\end{center}

\vskip.3in
Main idea: adapt SOP model to predict whether anti-dumping measures get renewed
\begin{itemize}
	\item Note that this is not trade war: foreign is applying $\tau^{*a}$ in most / all cases
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Q}: Are all cases of renewal ones of no punishment, i.e. target country is applying MFN tariff?
		\end{itemize}
	\item When is it worth it for lobby to exert effort to renew AD measure?
	\item Lobby must be able to trigger the AD measure in the first place
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This means disputes/non-adherence to MFN tariffs must happen on the equilibrium path
			\item Need uncertainty, asymmetric information, something
			\item In my model, it is symmetric political uncertainty about how legislators (modeled in reduced form as position of median legislator) will vote
		\end{itemize}
	\item In this setup, need ``dispute'' to last for 5 periods (years)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Then can extend it.
			\item \textbf{Q}: for five more years?
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chad and Maurizio Zanardi are working on a paper on AD 5-year reviews
		\begin{itemize}
			\item After five years, they come up for review 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Some AD measures get removed, some not, some go to dispute
					\item This is, of course, conditional on getting to five years
				\end{itemize}
			\item They have the data, but are not exploiting cross-industry variation
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Instead, aggregate variation, things like recessions, exchange rates
				\end{itemize}
			\item They don't have a theory for the cross-industry variation, because the economic determinants are meaningless after five years
				\begin{itemize}
					\item No injury, import surges: they've been protected for five years. No variation in new economic date b/c they've been insulated
					\item What's the economic test? There really isn't one. ``Would there be injury if we removed the duty?''
					\item Politics could be that theory (my theory from above)
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Q: Does hiring of lawyers for AD procedure get caught up in LDA data?
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
